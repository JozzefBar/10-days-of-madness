# 10 Days Of Madness (Very dramatic name for just letters in terminal lol)

## Basic info
- Simple game with basic mechanics. Finding items, exploring buildings, trying to survive and killings zombies with story at the start and end. **Everything is only in basic console**, where you are writing inputs (some specific char or number).
- There are **descriptions** almost everywhere in the code, so you do not get lost. There may be some errors mostly **segmentation faults**. Be aware of it.

## WHY?

- The idea of this game was from mobile game **fallout shelter** (when you send a dweller to a Wasteland - the log of things they do).
- The point of creating was to find out how much I have learnt from **Programming 2** in the second semester at FEI STU and use all of that to create something fun.

## What does it contain?
- (There are some functions created on purpose in a **complex way** so that I can test different syntax in C, (e.x function - create_armor)
- That is why there are only used basic **C functions and libraries**. **Story** is created with **ChatGPT** (There was no goal to make some great story telling, but just some simple story with start and end)

## Possible improvements
Things that planned to be done, but I didn't manage to do them: 
- Kill counter (for every kill - 1 score point), 
- More applicable items + crafting + something like legendary items etc.,
- Save/Load mechanics, 
- Some simple money system + finding trader during the game, 
- More macros for the size of lists in code,
- Better balance system - game stage or sth. (So you do not get the best weapon and armor on day one),
- Make difficulties or at least make the game harder to finnish (now if you are not completely unlucky you win almost everytime)

## Last information
 - All probabilities are written in the document
 - I understand that the code is confusing and inefficient and blah blah :). I already know that this is not how games are made (not in C at all), but I still wanted to try to come up with something and try something different, especially when I had time after the end of the 2nd semester.
