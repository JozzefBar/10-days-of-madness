In the midst of chaos and the relentless pursuit of the undead, you stumble upon a crumpled piece of paper. The writing is hurried, the ink smudged, but the message is clear:


To Whoever Finds This,

If you are reading this, it means you are still alive. There is hope. Journey from here, there is a safe haven. A place untouched by the horrors that have engulfed our world.

Head north. Follow the old highway. You will need to navigate through the abandoned towns and treacherous landscapes, but if you keep moving, you can make it. Supplies are scarce, but with caution and determination, you can survive.

Remember, this is your only chance. Gather what you can, trust no one, and move swiftly. The sanctuary awaits, but only for those who dare to seek it.

Stay safe, and may fortune favor the brave.
 
----  A Survivor
